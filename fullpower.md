When I was a junior in high school, I had the opportunity to an internship with [Fullpower Technologies](https://www.fullpower.com/). Fullpower is a technology company that develops fitness and health products. During my first summer there, I worked on app testing and a web development project. The following summer, I went back to Fullpower, and they were developing a new sleep tracking bed that would record heart rate and breathing data while the user slept. Since the timeline for this product was short, and stress was high at the company, I was given more responsibility. I wrote a lot of data collection and test automation scripts in Python to expidite prototype development. I also wrote a program that started a web server on a BeagleBone Black and served diagnostic information. This made it easy for engineers to type in the IP address of the BeagleBone and determine its state.

Although I did gain programming experince at Fullpower, I think the most important thing I gained was an understanding of how things work in industry. Having this before college became incredibly valuable, becuase in [PolySat,]({{site.baseurl}}/polysat) we regularly communicate with large companies with certain expectation of professionalism for telecons, emails, and meetings.
