*Project Overview:*

- Worked with the PolySat team to prepare a presentation for a Northrop Grumman system requirements review (SRR)
- Presented a command and data handling subsystem to a team of Northrop reviewers

<br>

One of the projects that is currently in the funding phase for PolySat is a 3U CubeSat we plan to do with Northrop Grumman. In order to procure funding for the satellite, our team was required to present at a system requirements review (SRR) at the Northrop Grumman facility in El Segundo, California. After several weeks of preparation, I presented the satellite's command and data handling subsystem to a team of reviewers.

In addition to being a great introduction to system engineering, the month of SRR preparation matured my ability to collaborate with a multidisciplinary team of engineers.
