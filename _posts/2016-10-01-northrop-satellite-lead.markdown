*Project Overview:*

- Led a multidisciplinary team of engineers to design a spacecraft intended to launch in 2018.
- Worked with Northrop employees to manage spacecraft requirements and funding.

I am currently the project lead for a 3U satellite PolySat is doing with Northrop Grumman. This entails leading a team of aerospace, electrical, mechanical, and software engineers to design a spacecraft. In addition, I regularly communicate with Northrop employees to manage funding, evaluate requirements, and make design decisions. This satellite is still in the design phase; however, it has an aggressive schedule, hopefully launching sometime in 2018.

The project went through System Requirements Review last Spring, and we are currently working on procuring funding.
