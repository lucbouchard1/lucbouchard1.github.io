# Project Jupyter

Starting in Spring 2017, I started contributing to [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), an open source platform for interactive computing. Project Jupyter's most popular project is the Jupyter Notebook, which is pictured below. It runs in the browser, and it is intended primarily for students, data scientists, scientists, and engineers.

This project gave me a lot of experience with web development, which before the summer of 2017 was just something I had played around with.

## JupyterLab Native

Recently, Project Jupyter has been developing their next generation development environment, [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab). Starting in the summer of 2017, I've been developing the native version of this app using [electron](https://electron.atom.io/). You can find the github page for the project [here](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab_app).

The native version of JupyterLab takes advantage of native API's to augment to JupyterLab experience. Through this project, I gained a large amount of experience with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and other web development technologies.

I also worked closely with the Jupyter designers to improve the JupyterLab Native experience. Above is a picture from one of many design brainstorms.
