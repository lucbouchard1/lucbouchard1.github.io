*Project Overview:*

- Led a multidisciplinary team of engineers to design a spacecraft intended to launch in 2018.
- Worked with Northrop employees to manage spacecraft requirements and funding.

<br>

I am currently the project lead for a 3U satellite PolySat is doing with Northrop Grumman. This entails leading a team of aerospace, electrical, mechanical, and software engineers to design a spacecraft. In addition, I regularly communicate with Northrop employees to manage funding, evaluate requirements, and make design decisions. This satellite is still in the design phase; however, it has an aggressive schedule, hopefully launching sometime in 2018.

<br>

The project went through System Requirements Review last Spring, and we are currently working on procuring funding.

*Project Overview:*

- Worked with the PolySat team to prepare a presentation for a Northrop Grumman system requirements review (SRR)
- Presented a command and data handling subsystem to a team of Northrop reviewers

<br>

One of the projects that is currently in the funding phase for PolySat is a 3U CubeSat we plan to do with Northrop Grumman. In order to procure funding for the satellite, our team was required to present at a system requirements review (SRR) at the Northrop Grumman facility in El Segundo, California. After several weeks of preparation, I presented the satellite's command and data handling subsystem to a team of reviewers.

In addition to being a great introduction to system engineering, the month of SRR preparation matured my ability to collaborate with a multidisciplinary team of engineers.
