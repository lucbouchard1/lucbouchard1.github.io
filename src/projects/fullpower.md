When I was a junior in high school, I had the opportunity to do an internship with [Fullpower Technologies](https://www.fullpower.com/). Fullpower is a technology company that develops fitness and health products under the MotionX and Sleeptracker brands. During my first summer there, I worked on app testing and a web development project. The following summer, I went back to Fullpower and helped with a new sleep-tracking bed that recorded heart and breathing rate while a user slept. Since the timeline for that product was short, and stress was high at the company, I was given more responsibility. I wrote several data collection and test automation scripts in Python to expidite prototype development. I also wrote a program that started a web server on a BeagleBone Black and served diagnostic information. This made it easy for engineers to determine the state of a prototype by typing its IP address into a web browser.

Although I did gain great programming experince at Fullpower, I think the most important thing I gained was an understanding of how things work in industry. Having this before college became incredibly valuable, becuase as a part of [PolySat]({{site.baseurl}}/polysat), I regularly communicate with large companies that have certain expectations of professionalism for telecons, emails, and meetings.
